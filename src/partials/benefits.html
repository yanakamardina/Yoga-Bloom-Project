        <h3>Reduces Stress & Anxiety</h3>
        <p>
          Regular yoga practice lowers cortisol levels and calms the nervous
          system — helping you feel more grounded, focused, and emotionally
          balanced.

        <h3>Builds Strength & Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          Yoga gently tones your body while increasing mobility and posture
          awareness — without strain or pressure. Great for beginners and
          experienced movers alike.

        <h3>Improves Sleep & Energy</h3>
        <p>
          Mindful movement and breathing techniques improve sleep quality and
          leave you feeling more refreshed, focused, and energized throughout
          the day.

        <h3>Boosts Mental Clarity & Focus</h3>
        <p>
          Yoga encourages present-moment awareness. Through mindful movement and
          breathwork, it sharpens concentration, improves memory, and clears
          mental fog.
